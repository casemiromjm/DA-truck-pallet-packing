# TODO
- [X] T1.1 - Simple command-line menu that shows all implemented functionalities. Must be possible to choose a dataset, choose the algorithmic approach and view the reuslts. (1.0 point)
- [X] T1.2 - Read and Parse input data. This funcionality is accessible through menu (0.5 points)
- [X] T1.3 - Documentation using Doxygen for all implemented code. It should indicate *time **AND** space complexity for each algorithm*. (1.5 points)

- [X] T2.1 - *Exhaustive / Brute-Force Approach*. Analyze performance of this approach. Can implement a backtracking approach to try to improve effiency. (3.0 points)
- [X] T2.2 - *Dynamic Programming Approach*. Analyze performance of this approach. Evaluate using alternatives data structures and consider implementing a custom solution. (3.0 points)
- [X] T2.3 - *Greedy / Approximation Approach*. Algorithm based on weight/profit ratio. Evaluate performance and fidelity of this approach. Analyze accuracy and perfomance of this approach in comparison to the previous two approaches (in small datasets). (3.0 points)
- [ ] T2.4 - *Integer Linear Programming Approach*. Should develop and analyse pur own ILP approach. Should mathematically formulate the 0/1 KP properly as an ILP. As an alternative to ILP, we can use other approach like Genetic Algortihms or a Hybrid Algorithmic approach suited to selected input datasets. Critically discuss the reason for the algorithms implemented. (2.0 points)

- [X] T3.1 - Evaluate and compare algorithms. Test implementation on provided datasets. Measure and report the run time execution for each algorihtm and dataset, it should have a graphical representation of each perfomance. Compare the space complexity of different solutions. Compare the accuracy of different solutions. (2.0 points)
